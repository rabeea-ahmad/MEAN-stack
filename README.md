# Mean Stack Template
Since setting up a new app every time takes way too long, this is my bare bones MEAN stack template. I'll be adding SASS, a bower.json and some neat Angular stuff (nav bar, proper routing, etc.) soon. Enjoy!
 
## How to run

1) Clone repository and download npm packages 

```
git clone
npm install
```

2) Launch mongod and the server

````
mongod
node server.js

4) Profit
